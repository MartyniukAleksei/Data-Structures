# Data Structures
## It's a project with implementations of basic data structures in C++
### Data structures in the project:
***
  ### 1. Binary Search Tree:
  An implementation of a dynamically balanced binary search tree with support for common operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal. 
  The tree maintains balance automatically after updates, ensuring optimal performance. Includes additional utility methods such as height calculation,
  bounds queries, and BFS/DFS printing.
***
  ### 2. Linked List:
  A lightweight C++ implementation of a singly linked list supporting common operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements. The class includes
  utilities for inserting at specific indices, clearing the list, and supports operator overloading for convenient usage.
